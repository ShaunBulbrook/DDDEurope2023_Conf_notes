Andreas Pinhammer

Very soft-spoken speaker who managed to race through the whole talk in a short time.

Andreas talked about the process his business (insurance) went through when adapting to a DDD approach. A very real journey through adapting this approach with a single product, trying to expand to two and discovering that the domain boundaries were in the wrong place. 

We then saw the emergence of the platform layer. Suddenly this feature from team topologies really clicked. It had me reminiscing about the team structure with an insurance client with awesome platform teams. I now wonder how intentional that structuring was... 

We also covered the creation of an anti-corruption layer (ice wall) between the businesses legacy software and the DDD products. Essentially proxies to those services. An interesting point made that while right now the product teams need to maintain these, really these are the responsibility of the legacy systems and one day ownership should be passed to them. (Presently not possible as they still need to win buy-in from those teams.)
