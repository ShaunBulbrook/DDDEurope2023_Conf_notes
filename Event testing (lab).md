- Event testing ^^

Covered quite a lot in this session. I'm not sure that I'm wholley convinced by this approach, but I'm really keen to dig deeper. 

The premise was that this presenters had created a testing framework that allowed them to fire a domain event. After this occurred, they could check that another domain event had been fired with the relevant state changes.

Since until this point I haven't paid too much attention to domain events, this was a fairly new pattern to me. I need to do some re-reading on CQRS+ES and perhaps look at how those principles can be better incorporated into work before this pattern becomes more useful. 

Although we didn't quite have enough time, there seemed to be the promise of good saga examples in the code base. Looking forward to checking those out.
