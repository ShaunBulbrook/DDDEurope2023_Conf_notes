- cost of sofrrware is quivilent to the cost of change. 
- (Constantine's equivilence) (lu)
- Big changes dominate the costs
- Big changes occur as a result of coupling. 
- Cost of software = coupling

- Cohesion is where elements that depend on each other are coupled in the same space. (.>> internal functions conversation with Henry)

Well, it's Kent Beck, so it was almost certainly going to be good. His breakdown of where the costs in software development come from were clear and succinct. I look forward to seeing how I manage to balls it up when attempting to pass it along in the weeks to come! 

In a nutshell, the largest costs in software come from the need to change. Changes are most hard when dealing with coupling. We then explored coupling and cohesion. Kent mentioned it taking something like 15 years to get to the point of being able to explain cohesion succinctly. I'm not going to try in these pages. - This talk is one to watch again for sure.
