# DDD Europe 2023

Here are some little write-ups of some of the sessions I attended over three days at Domain Driven Design Europe 2023. Keep in mind, that these are **not talk summaries or comprehensive notes on these subject matters**.

These articles are distilled from notes and photos taken during the session and the first draft on each is written _after_ I've had a few beers in the late evening. Expect not to see things that I _think_ I already know. Also don't expect to see anything that was so fascinating, that I stopped to listen instead of take notes.

Speaker details are included if you want to go and find out more.

On the whole, this was a wonderful conference with a great lineup, I'm excited to start experimenting with all these perspectives and ideas I've been exposed to.

Talk summaries are available at the links below. I've attempted to pull out referenced materials and recommended reading onto this page for easy access.
