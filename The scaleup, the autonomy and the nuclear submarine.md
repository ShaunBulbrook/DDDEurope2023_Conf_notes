Timeline 
- 3 months to figure out direction
- 6 months to identify individuals**


This talk told the story of a transformation in a scaleup and focused a great deal on leadership in autonomous environments. This involved applying a loose structure to help guide team members on how to direct their autonomous activities. The talk used the book *Turn the ship around* as a device to talk about this activity was guided. 

The outcome described was a team that made decisions in a highly autonomous manner. 

> Whoever has the information has the authority to make decisions

The manner this autonomy was wielded was by having these decisions broadcast in good time. 

I was heartened a little to hear that this wasn't something the speakers managed to achieve overnight. It was intriguing that it took three months for the VP to figure out the direction and then another three months to identify the individuals capable of leadership. I have a feeling I put too much pressure on these things. 

Key takeaways here were the need to provision space, both in meetings/conversations and when goals are passed down. Though I'm left wondering how to win buy-in. I think some of the tactical points here tie in could tie in very well with the points made in [[Systems thinking in large scale modeling]]. 

> Autonomy != Autarchy
