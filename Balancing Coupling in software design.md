Really great talk. A simple concept that I've always had a "gut feel" for -- coupling. This speaker is also an author and one who I will certainly be reading. This talk covered material from a book in progress. 

The main takeaway in regard to coupling was the formula

PAIN = f(strength, volatility ,distance)

Minimise  one of those factors and then you discover a sensible coupling.

Kent Beck then expanded on this formula with [[]]
