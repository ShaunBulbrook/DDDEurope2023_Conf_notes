Mathias Verras, Romeu Moura


heuristics
- When a head gets too full, it's time to stop
- domain experts are human 
	- I should be able to say "this is too much too fast"
- Overshooting
	- there's something that we could have built
	- (have to overshoot to see it )
- Domain always looks simpler then it is
- A domain expert already has a model (which is simpler then it is )
- when in doubt, write the test
- $If you have a conflict, you should have the conflict. 
- The UI is not the model. 
- When the whiteboard is full, people stop drawing. 
	- 



DDD helps manage complex domains. (-- >> design activity for complicated/chaotic/clear domains?)


> The whiteboard always compiles


> Putting too much in your head is an act of self-harm, write a test. 


- Writing fail cases (unhappy path) tests first
	- creates an illusion of progress through code. - Not through model.




Property based testing for the masses (talk lu) [[Todos (Backlinked)]]


I'd already enjoyed Romeu's previous talk [[TDD Beyond the basics (Part 1)]]. In this lab he carried over the same attitude and switched on thinking right through the session. I was really taken aback by Mathias's ability to highlight when things were going wrong and had gone wrong. This seemed almost like a twisted real-time re-enactment of parts of [[From Vision to code]].

The speakers laid down some ground rules which I'm keen to experiment with in the groups I work in day-to-day

## Rules
1. I'm not your ~~daddy~~ parent
2. Law of two feet - *If you find yourself in a situation where you are not contributing or learning, move somewhere where you can*
3. The group is your responsibility.

## The exercise

The pair took the game pandemic (which Mathias hadn't played before) and started breaking it down into its component parts. Romeu began by explaining the domain (which being a game with defined rules and boundaries was a complicated, *not* a complex domain which negated the need for a DDD approach somewhat.)

As they started moving through the problem we reached a point where Mathias needed to stop to process. The language caused immediate empathy. How many times have I been in a mob trying to force myself to just hear everything. By communicating his needs Mathias started to produce heuristics which the pair could follow.
