Coming into this talk, I had a different ideas about exactly what a heuristic was and attached the term to specific patterns with a consideration that they may not always be true.

Through this session, I recalled with some delight mobs I worked in that created *rules* that we would follow for minutes or hours before elevating something more important. This was the term needed. Not *rules*, *heuristics*. 

During the session, we dug into heuristics that the attendees use in general and looked to the values that drove those heuristics. This was followed by a brief chat around the differences between values and principles. 

In the final part of the session, we looked at designing experiments. I enjoyed the formula which saw myself and a fellow attendee design an experiment around some data they wanted to collect.

## Formula

1. What actions you will take? What will you try?
2. What are the anticipated results?
3. What are some possible side-effects?
4. What do you hope to learn?
