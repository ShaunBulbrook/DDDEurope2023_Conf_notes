> You are a stupid ape



*Apprach TDD with a draft  mindset*

- Why TDD
- What is a test? Ontological epistemological aesthtical (lu)
	- asking questions about the domain
	- testing is also helping archeology
- Maieutics?
- Aporiia?
- Meditation?


- Lazy naming 
	- Assertions should explain the test's bhaviour
	- 

1. Understanding 
2. Then write
3. Then name.


- "Fight between the impression of speed versus speed"
	- Everything you can do to increase  speed of  discovery is increasing  speed overrall
	- "Drafts are  your friend"

- aridne's thread (greek mythos, laberinth) - put knowloedge into the envirronment

- A green bar (state) is a permission to think
	- Discussing and collboarting while there is red bar is an heuristic for failure

- >> One test at a time?
	- As many tests  as can be answered in a single step.

Such a great Talk. Romeu paced his delivery of this whole thing just right. I'm very gutted to have missed out on part 2 and will absolutely be watching the video. 

This talk cented around a TDD approach to fizzbuzz. So many good points raised out of it. (See other notes)
