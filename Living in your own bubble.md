An exciting dive into the world of bovine management. I'd never really thought about how much data processing needs to exist to manage a nations cows. 

Jacob took us through a story of when he arrived to a legacy codebase and attempted to recover from it using a [Bubble context](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettingStartedWithDDDWhenSurroundedByLegacySystemsV1.pdf). The code being legacy presented a bit of a challenge to step through in a live coding session. I didn't quite grasp what the *bubble* is doing over and above the anti-corruption layer. I'll need to get myself through the [source code](https://github.com/jacobduijzer/LivingInYourOwnBubble) and [paper](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettingStartedWithDDDWhenSurroundedByLegacySystemsV1.pdf) later. 

He seemed like a solid presenter and also later gave one of the [[Lightning talks]] on  team topologies.
