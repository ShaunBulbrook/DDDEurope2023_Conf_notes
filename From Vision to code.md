Marco and Ferdi had prepared a kind of play where they illustrated conversations between a PO and a developer over a months time. 

As a medium of their communication, they used typescript types as a common artifact to base the modelling conversations around. Given past experiences at various agencies where I failed to get any non-developer to technical subject matter like markdown, I initially thought that this was going to be acted out as a failure. 

It wasn't and they continued, effectively defining this model and also introducing me to the typescript concept of branding where they were able to distinguish between an entity and an updated variant of it, illustrating how using such a type could eliminate the possibility of the wrong one being used in error. (And in such a way that followed business rules.)

I later caught up with {LONG HAIRED ONE} and asked him about his experiences using types with clients. He told me that he'd found great success with it. I'm very curious to see if we can experiment with such an approach.
