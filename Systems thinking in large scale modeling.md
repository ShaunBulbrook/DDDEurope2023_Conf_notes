Really great talk from Xin Yao. One I plan to re-watch. Such a great story on how she handled a team that was unengaged with the eventstorming workshops her team was running. (She asked questions and listened, got the team onside). 

Covered causal loop diagrams really well. I had previously understood the mechanics of writing them, but I'd never quite understood that these things evolve. Some wonderful examples of how balancing loops get discovered. I would have wanted to write more about these, but I think I may just go fin

Also wonderful points about perception and bias. I found myself reflecting on old informal diagrams I'd written and how naive they must have been. Keen to try documenting with these once again, perhaps revisiting them periodically rather then prepare one for a single meeting.
